# TutorialPathfinding
A tutorial on Terasology's various pathfinding topics.
It also doubles as a testing area for Pathfinding.

## Testing Instructions
Inventory item 3 is a spawner block, item 4 is a target block. Place the blocks at appropriate positions. Item 2 is the activation item. Switch to it, and right click. You should see a floating cube spawn at the spawner.

## Issues
- Currently, very hacky as I couldn't figure out how to use location components properly.
- Facing issues with components values magically changing at different places.
- Computing of a path always seems to return null
